# EventTrackerProject

My Event Tracker is a REST API project, that will track my Mech Arena battle stats. This will be a full-stack web application that will make use of CRUD operations that were implemented in the project.

With this web application a user is able to record game play statistics for a game called "Mech Arena"
you can create, update and delete: Kills, wins, tiered MVP rankings, points, Fire power/damage dealt to opponents,  
and control point captures. 

This application was developed in Spring Tools Suite and tested using j-unit and Postman.
currently there is a Javascript front end being implemented. 

Currently there is an Angular Front end with CRUD Functions

###Lessons Learned

In starting this project I got more familiar with MYSQL work bench, building out a database is something that I really needed to challenge myself with, I did get ahead of myself and a bit ambitious, hopefully at some point I can complete my stretch goals and add two more tables.

The back end Programming I'm getting a lot faster with, however Javascript i'm finding a bit difficult, and on top of that I find that i'm making a lot of typing errors to compound my mistakes. I fee like I know how things are supposed to go, I just need to keep working on execution.

I've noticed over the past 12 weeks, that on Sunday night i'm at a point that i would have liked to have been Saturday morning.

I have struggled a lot, but I have gotten through it for the most part. Despite not being able to make this project what I wanted during the time given I've gained a lot of confidence that I can continue learning and get better in this field.

I'm not a fan of finding curly braces in the full stack.....In the future I will be more mindful of where the class closing curly brace is. looking for it in two differn't Angular files consumed a lot of my time on this project.
