###Lessons Learned

In starting this project I got more familiar with MYSQL work bench, building out a database is something that I really needed to challenge myself with, I did get ahead of myself and a bit ambitious, hopefully at some point I can complete my stretch goals and add two more tables.

The back end Programming I'm getting a lot faster with, however Javascript i'm finding a bit difficult, and on top of that I find that i'm making a lot of typing errors to compound my mistakes. I fee like I know how things are supposed to go, I just need to keep working on execution.

I've noticed over the past 12 weeks, that on Sunday night i'm at a point that i would have liked to have been Saturday morning.
